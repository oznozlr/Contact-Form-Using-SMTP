# Contact-Form-Using-SMTP
<h2>Contact Form Using SMTP With ASP.NET MVC</h2>
<p>This project is a web application developed to create a contact form using ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The project is designed to allow users to contact the website owner.</p>
<h3>Project Details:</h3>
<p>The project was built with the ASP.NET MVC project template using the Visual Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
Project layers are decoupled using ASP.NET MVC's Model-View-Controller architecture.
The contact form is located on a page in the web application's interface. Users can submit their communication requests by logging in to the name, e-mail address, subject and message fields.
The data entered by the users has been validated on the server side and incorrect entries have been prevented.
Using the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) protocol, the user's communication request is automatically forwarded to the specified e-mail address.
The project performs sending e-mails using the SmtpClient class included in the .NET Framework libraries.
The project uses data bindings and parameterized queries for user inputs to minimize security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3>Technologies and Tools:</h3>
<li>ASP.NET MVC Framework</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>C# programming language</li>
<li>SMTP and email sending methods</li>

<h3>My Contributions:</h3>

<p>By designing all phases of the project, I created the layers in accordance with the MVC architecture.
I developed the design and user interface of the contact form with HTML and CSS.
I have done the necessary coding to validate user inputs and handle faulty situations in C#.
I wrote the codes that manage sending emails using the SMTP protocol.
By completing the test phases of the project, I made bug fixes and improvements.</p>
